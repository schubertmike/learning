<!-- my understanding is, HTML is the structure of the content on the website, CSS is to make it pretty, and Javascript is to give it functionality-->


<!-- This first section is all about the basic elements of html. First thing is basic syntax, familiarizing with the <body> (aka, where most of the html will go), and the <p>, or paragraph tag -->
<!-- I am a tabs guy, even though my tutorials are teaching spaces :( -->

<!-- familiarizing with the <h1> through <h6> tags, as well as the line break tag <br> -->

<!-- getting to know the basic formatting tags <b> or bold <i> or italiciz <u> or underline <s> or strikethrough -->
  	<p><b>Cutting Down, Ramping Up:</b> We have a robust strategy for <s>low-hanging fruits</s> mission-critical objectives that move the needle at all costs.

<!-- getting to know lists. unordered lists - or bulleted lists, and ordered lists - or numbered lists. Recreated the lists in a recipe I found online-->
	 <ul>
	    <li>1 lb large shrimp peeled and deveined</li>
	    <li>Kosher salt</li>
	    <li>¬Ω cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
	    <li>10 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
	    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (start with less if you don't want it too spicy)</li>
	    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
	    <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry or dry white wine</li>
	    <li>Juice of ¬Ω lemon</li>
	    <li>¬Ω cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
	  </ul>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Pat the shrimp dry and season with kosher salt. Set aside for now.</li>
	    <li>Heat the extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat up to 60 seconds or until the garlic gains some color (be careful not to burn it).</li>
	    <li>Add the shrimp and paprika. Cook briefly, tossing regularly, and watching that the flesh turns opaque with a pearly pink color (about 3 minutes or so; this will depend on the size of the shrimp). Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
	    <li>Stir in sherry, lemon juice and parsley.</li>
	    <li>Transfer the shrimp and sauce to a serving bowl. Serve with your favorite crusty bread.</li>
	  </ol>

<!-- next section is all about structure, the doctype, the head, the body, the title, parents and children (i.e. <ol> and <li>). Plus, commenting, which is used heavily here, elemental arrtibutes like name, value, type, href, src, alt, target, etc. After that we'll get a peak at css with the <style> tag in the head, and finish with another mini project -->
<!-- first section is for forms <form>, also includes the action attribute (telling where to go after submission), and the method attribute (how the data is processed) -->
<form action="post" method=""></form>

<!-- then there's the <input> tag. With the type attribute, it will specify what field to provide (text, radial, submit, etc)-->
<input type="text"></input>

<!-- more input types -->
