				<h2>Menu - Coffee, Matcha, and Food</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>Flat White</h3>
					<img src="flat-white.jpg" />
					<p>Our beans rotate monthly from the finest growers around the world.<br><br>As for our Baristas, think of a sushi chef. Think of the time and dedication it takes to perfect the art of sushi making, then apply that to coffee. Our baristas have spent 10+ years in the coffee and hospitality industries to perfect their craft, and we pay them like it. Plus, They've spent 2 years perfecting their latte art to not only give you the tastiest cup of coffee you've ever had, but to give you the most aesthetic cup too.</p>

					<h3>Affogato</h3>
					<img src="affogato.jpg" alt="Coffee pouring on Vanilla Ice-Cream" width="50%" height="50%"/>
					<p>We use Madagasgar vanilla beans and cream from the Pacific North West's dairy cows in order to make our Vanilla Ice Cream.<br><br>We blend it with Brazillian sugar, and chill it overnight for the perfect, creamy texture. <br>Two scoops are put in a glass, then we brew some espresso, using a special blend of beans (not included in our monthly rotation).<br><br> Last, but certainly not least, we bring the glass to you and pour the coffee over the ice cream to give you the most immersive experience.</p>

					<h3>Matcha Latte</h3>
					<img src="matcha-latte.jpg" />
					<p>We've spent years finding the perfect ratio of matcha to milk to sweetener to ice, to give you the perfect matcha latte.<br><br>We travelled to Japan to discover the perfect matcha for this latte. We tried over 100 matcha producers across the country and found the perfect one, from Uji Japan.</p>
					<h4>Select between 3 of our favorite sweeteners from across the globe:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Wild flower honey, from local beekeepers here in Washington</li>
						<li>Real, genuine maple syrup, sourced directly from Canadas oldest and finest producer</li>
						<li>Our Special, house-made brown sugar syrup, with brown sugar made in Brazil</li>
