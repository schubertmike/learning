//below is a simple exercise to convert the current temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
let currentTempF = 50; //current tempurature at my location (hardcoded, but changeable, using a let variable), in F degrees
let newTempC = (currentTempF - 32) / 1.8; //conversion from F degrees to C degrees using the conversion formula of C temp = (F degrees - 32) / 1.8

console.log(newTempC); //print C degrees temp, based on the above conversion
