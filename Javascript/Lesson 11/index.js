//learning about conditionals
let num = Math.random(); //variable num = random number generator. my guess is between 0 and 1

if(num > 0.5) { //conditional if the random number is greater than .5
  console.log("Heads"); // print heads
} else { // else its any other number (.5 and lower)
  console.log("Tails"); // print tails
}
