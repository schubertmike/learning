//learning about indeces. array indeces start at 0 (for most programming languages)
//we can change the value of an existing element in the array
//we can assign a new value to an index that doesn't exist yet as well
//array index example below

let groceryList = ["🥛 Milk", "🥑 Avocado", "🥚 Eggs", "🍞 Bread"]; //establishing array variable

groceryList[2] = "🧈 Butter"; //replaced eggs with butter
groceryList[4] = "🧼 Laundry Soap"; //added laundry soap at the end

console.log(groceryList); //print array
