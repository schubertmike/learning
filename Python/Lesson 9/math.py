#learning about input and int
#input captures a... input from the user
#int can convert something to an integer

#we can use these to capture the input, then do math with it. So here's the pythagorean theorem

a = int(input("How long is the A side of the triangle?"))

print(a)

b = int(input("How long is the B side of the triangle"))

print(b)

c = ((a**2) + (b**2))**0.5

print(c)
