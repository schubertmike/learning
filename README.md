# learning
For all programming related learning, especially projects

Starting with HTML. From there, I move into CSS. Then I tackle a bit of Javascript, and move to python (so I can start data science and hardware programming), I will move onto C++ for low level knowledge.

Each language, other than HTML, will be a branch of the main repository.

I have been using sublime text as my code editor to learn, but have switched to VS Code, since I can run code locally (without having to save the file, then refresh my webpage)
